# React Week-1 Examples

A beginner-friendly React application built with Vite, showcasing basic React concepts and components.

## 🚀 Features

This project includes the following React examples:

- **Counter App**: Increment, decrement, and reset a counter using useState.
- **Input Form**: Collect name and email, display submitted data.
- **Todo List**: Add, delete, and mark todos as completed.
- **API Fetch**: Fetch data from JSONPlaceholder API with loading state.
- **Reusable Button**: A reusable component demonstrating props usage.

All components use functional components and React hooks.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React 18
- Vite (for fast development)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS for styling
