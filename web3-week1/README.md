# Week 1 – Web3 Smart Contracts (Sepolia)

This folder contains Solidity smart contracts developed and deployed on the  
**Ethereum Sepolia Test Network** using **Remix IDE**.

---

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Remix IDE  
- MetaMask Wallet  
- Ethereum Sepolia Test Network  

---

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- MetaMask wallet setup  
- Sepolia test network configuration  
- Smart contract development using Solidity  
- Smart contract deployment using Remix IDE  
- Contract interaction and testing (functions execution)

---

## 📜 Deployed Smart Contracts

### 1️⃣ HelloWorld Contract
- Network: Ethereum Sepolia  
- Deployment Tool: Remix IDE  
- Description: Stores and returns a greeting message on the blockchain.

**Contract Address:**  
`<PASTE_HELLOWORLD_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE>`

---

### 2️⃣ Counter Contract
- Network: Ethereum Sepolia  
- Deployment Tool: Remix IDE  
- Description:  
  A simple counter contract that allows incrementing and decrementing a number.

**Functions Tested:**
- `increment()` → Increases the counter value  
- `decrement()` → Decreases the counter value (restricted when count is 0)  
- `count()` → Returns the current counter value  

**Contract Address:**  
`<PASTE_COUNTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_HERE>`

---

## 🧪 Testing
- Functions tested directly from **Remix IDE → Deploy & Run Transactions**
- Transactions confirmed using **MetaMask**
- All interactions successfully recorded on Sepolia Test Network

---

## 📌 Notes
- All contracts were compiled with Solidity `^0.8.0`
- Gas fees paid using Sepolia test ETH
- Contracts verified and interacted with via Remix IDE

---

## 🚀 Status
✅ Week 1 Web3 Smart Contract tasks completed successfully
